## (IITC Plugin) Find optimally configured portals for Flash Fracking Farms for two agents.

Agent & Items requirements:
 * A Level 8 Agent
 * A Level 5+ Agent
 * 1 Very Rare Heat Sink
 * 1 Very Rare Multi-hack
 
Optional but highly recommended:
 * Level 8 Ultrastrikes
 * 5 Frackers
 * 1 JARVIS Virus or ADA Refactor
 * 2 Rare Heat Sinks

## How do I use this?
It's very simple. After installing f-cubed, you will simply see an alert like the one pictured above when you select a portal that is eligible for the method. 
The easiest way to do this is with the Portal List plugin, which allows you to sort and filter through a list of displayed portals.
From the alert box you can grab the portal link or grab directions to the portal immediately, using Google Maps.
#### f-cubed will show alerts for any portals that can become a friendly 8 and have two usable slots (for a VRMH and a VRHS).

## What are we trying to find?
In order to execute the F-cubed method of farming, a portal must be found fulfilling one the following requirements:
* Friendly Portal with six or more level 8 resonators and at least two open mod slots.
* Enemy Portal with seven or more level 8 resonators.

The *Most Optimal Portal* is one that you can make your own and fill every mod slot, which will usually be an enemy P7 - almost a P8.

## Method
Once you've got your eligible portal, prepare yourselves for some glyphing. It will take roughly 45 minutes to fully execute this method, maybe up to 60 the first few times as you get the hang of it. Because frackers are in play here, time counts. If you are using a friendly portal, skip steps 1 and 2.
1. Knock all mods off the portal with Ultrastrikes. *Make sure to avoid taking out resonators (P8s can tolerate one broken resonator).*
2. Flip the portal. If one agent is below level 8, have them do the flipping.
3. Deploy your fracker.
4. One agent applies a Very Rare Multi-hack. The other agent glyphs the portal, and then applies a Very Rare Heat Sink.
5. **HACK AWAY!** The cooldown is 90 seconds. Keep frackers deployed, recharging in between.
6. After burnout, each agent deploys a Rare Heat Sink to reset the burnout timer. The cooldown is now 50 seconds.

## Results

**The most optimal configuration provides 33 *unfracked* hacks *per agent* in 35 minutes, 51 seconds.** *Combined with Fracking, this method allows the equivalent of 130 glyphed hacks in under 45 minutes, split between two agents.*

The minimum result (no fracks, only two mod slots) is 33 hacks (between two agents) in 22 minutes, 30 seconds.

### Warning!

There is one catch. While it should rarely happen, because two mod slots are left open for the first 23 minutes of farming, it is possible to get griefed by a friendly player or noob deploying the other two mods.
